# PiTVSwitch
PiTVSwitch is a project that uses the Orange Pi to display the video feed from a Canon PTZ camera on your TV. The camera streams its video via a hosted web server, and a tablet on the production site allows users to change the URL of the stream being viewed by the Orange Pi, effectively switching between camera feeds.
